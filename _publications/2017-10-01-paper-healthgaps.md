We quantify gender-specific differences in retirement income in Germany, Denmark, and France. We show that the “gender pension gap” in Germany is higher than in France and much higher than in Denmark.
We also investigate gender-specific differences in health, i.e. the so-called “gender health gap”, in the same age group. Self-assessed general health in 2013 reveals no significant differences between men and women in the countries studied. However, gender-specific differences in depressive symptoms follow a similar pattern as the gender pension gap.
