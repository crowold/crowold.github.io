Which are the most important  life course aspects for wealth inequality in older age? Life course aspects cover the duration in specific states (e.g. the years being married), the order of events (e.g. marriage or divorce before or after childbirth), the timing of events (e.g. first child born at which age of parents) as well as the complete complexity of life courses. We first focus on family life courses and assessed how the relevant features are related to wealth inequalities, focussing particularly on the differences between men and women. 

Next, we also consider work life courses, next to the family dimension, and use the selected life course variables to decompose the Gender Wealth Gap.

Looking ahead, we are going to include country comparisons to assess to what extent country contexts such as norms and policies shape these mechanisms and include working life courses besides family life courses.

**Uncovering what matters: Family life course aspects and personal wealth in late working age**

<i>With Nicole Kapelle<i>
> Capturing the complexity of family life courses as predictors of later-life outcomes like wealth is challenging. Addressing this, we used German data and combined feature selection, sequence analysis tools, and regression techniques. This approach extends prior research that either (a) assessed a few selective but potentially irrelevant summary indicators, or (b) examined the relevance of entire life course clusters without identifying which specific aspects matter within and between clusters. We explored (I) which family life course aspects—encompassing the order, duration, and timing of states and transitions—are key wealth predictors for Western Germans aged 50 to 59. Additionally, we analysed (II) the strength and direction of associations between relevant aspects and wealth, and (III) whether these associations differ by gender. We identified 23 diverse features as relevant predictors, with two—the time spent never-married, both without and with children—deemed most relevant. Most features were negatively associated with wealth and characterised predominantly by single parenthood, marital separation or early marital transitions with or without fertility transitions. The prevalence and significance of associations between these features and wealth differed partly across genders. Results highlight the importance of previously concealed family life course features for wealth inequalities in late working age.

**Decomposing the Gender Wealth Gap in late working age based on the most relevant family and work life course aspects**

<i>With Nicole Kapelle<i>
> Less is known about the Gender Wealth Gap (GWG) and its drivers although private wealth is crucial for older-age financial well-being. Previous literature focuses on the role of cross-sectional employment characteristics or the employment duration when assessing the drivers of the GWG. However, these studies do not consider complexities over the life course beyond the duration in selected states, such as when or in what order transitions happen, and neglect the interlinked relationship between the family and work domain. Empirically addressing such complexity in family and work-life courses has, however, been challenging. The present study addresses this shortcoming by using a feature selection approach to detect the most important wealth-related life course predictors—paying attention to the timing, duration, order, and complexity of work-family life courses. Next, we decompose the GWG based on these predictors. 
The results suggest that the most important wealth predictors are the duration in education and unemployment – life course proxies that have been assessed previously. However, many variables follow that are related to more complex life course dynamics, such as the order and timing of events. Additionally, family life course states are important wealth predictors. Gender-specific results unveil further that life course wealth predictors differ largely across genders, with men-specific wealth predictors related to unemployment and full-time employment being more commonly covered in previous literature. 
However, the decomposition results suggest that predictors for women’s life courses tend to be more important drivers of the gender wealth gap. This is because comparable men do not experience similar combinations of life course aspects including homemaking and the unpredictability of working lives that are related to lower wealth.
