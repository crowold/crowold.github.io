In my dissertation I explore through which mechanisms Gender Pension Gaps are related to work-family life course patterns or specific aspects of work and family lives. Suggesting a new methodological approach and analyse the interrelation of welfare state policies over the life course with pension policies in place later in life.

Life-course-sensitive analysis of group inequalities in old age: Combining sequence analysis with the Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition 
------
This paper improves the understanding of how prior life-courses that unfold over several decades relate to inequalities between groups in old age. We propose a step wise process combining the strengths of Multichannel Sequence Analysis to analyse life-courses with the Kitagawa-Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition, which has long been established to analyse group inequalities in outcomes. The combination of both methods allows to reveal i) which part of group-specific gaps in outcomes are due to group-specific life course patterns and ii) which part is due to group-specific returns for the same life course patterns. To illustrate the proposed procedure, we apply it to the case of Gender Pension Gaps in Italy and West Germany.

Differences in Gender Pension Gaps in public and private pensions in West Germany: Which role do work-family life courses play?

How are work-family life courses associated with the Gender Pension Gap (GPG)? Do these mechanisms vary between the gender gap in public compared to private pensions? I assess these questions by applying an innovative combination of the Multichannel Sequence Analysis with the Kitagawa-Blinder-Oaxaca decomposition and linking survey to register data for Germany to decompose GPGs based on work-family life courses. Additionally, I decompose GPGs based on the relative earning positions of individuals over the life course. Differentiating between pension types sheds light on the impact of pension privatization and provides more targeted suggestions for policy makers. The results reveal that gender differences in life course patterns mirroring gender inequalities of current cohorts in labour force (e.g. Gender Wage Gap) drive the GPG in private pensions to a higher extent than the gap in public pensions highlighting the risk of high GPGs in the future.

Full-time employment is all that matters for gendered pension income inequality? Decomposing Gender Pension Gaps based on relevant life course features in Germany & the Netherlands

Gender Pension Gaps are so far either analysed based on one life course concept, mostly the duration in full-time employment, or based on life course typologies. Whereas the first one neglects other concepts such as the timing or ordering of events over the life course, the latter might conceal specific attributes of life courses particularly relevant for the Gender Pension Gap. This study addresses this gap in literature by identifying which life course features are most important in predicating pension income and comparing the welfare regimes of Germany and the Netherlands. Results show that duration of events plays a main role. However, it is not the duration full-time employment, but rather being engaged in unpaid care work that is most important. Beyond duration, timing and sequencing of events are relevant as well. As second step, a decomposition based on these identified features reveals the mechanisms shaping the Gender Pension Gaps across countries.
