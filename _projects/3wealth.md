Which are the most important family life course aspects for wealth inequality in older age? Life course aspects cover the duration in specific states (e.g. the years being married), the order of events (e.g. marriage or divorce before or after childbirth), the timing of events (e.g. first child born at which age of parents) as well as the complete complexity of life courses. We then assess how these features are related to wealth inequalities, focussing particularly on the differences between men and women. 
Looking ahead, we are going to include country comparisons to assess to what extent country contexts such as norms and policies shape these mechanisms and include working life courses besides family life courses.

**Family life trajectory features and personal wealth of women and men in older age**

<i>With Nicole Kapelle<i>
> This  paper examines (I) which family life course trajectory features covering elements of the order, duration, and timing of states/events are most relevant for wealth in older age and (II) how these features are related to wealth focusing also on (III) wealth stratification by gender. Using German data and an approach that combines machine learning feature selection algorithms and sequence analyses tools with regression techniques, we extend previous research that either (I) assessed few, but potentially irrelevant summary indicators in regressions or (II) examined the relevance of entire life course clusters using sequence analyses and regressions without determining which single features matter. We identify 22 relevant features with duration-related variables deemed as most important and timing-related variables as most common among the selected features. Next, we will assess how these aspects predict women’s and men’s wealth in older age. Results will provide important impulses for inequality research and policy-related discussions.
