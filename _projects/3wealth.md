Which are the most important  life course aspects for wealth inequality in older age? Life course aspects cover the duration in specific states (e.g. the years being married), the order of events (e.g. marriage or divorce before or after childbirth), the timing of events (e.g. first child born at which age of parents) as well as the complete complexity of life courses. We first focus on family life courses and assessed how the relevant features are related to wealth inequalities, focussing particularly on the differences between men and women. 

Next, we also consider work life courses, next to the family dimension, and use the selected life course variables to decompose the Gender Wealth Gap.

Looking ahead, we are going to include country comparisons to assess to what extent country contexts such as norms and policies shape these mechanisms and include working life courses besides family life courses.

**Uncovering what matters: Family life course aspects and personal wealth in late working age**

<i>With Nicole Kapelle<i>
> This  paper examines (I) which family life course trajectory features covering elements of the order, duration, and timing of states/events are most relevant for wealth in older age and (II) how these features are related to wealth focusing also on (III) wealth stratification by gender. Using German data and an approach that combines machine learning feature selection algorithms and sequence analyses tools with regression techniques, we extend previous research that either (I) assessed few, but potentially irrelevant summary indicators in regressions or (II) examined the relevance of entire life course clusters using sequence analyses and regressions without determining which single features matter. We identify 22 relevant features with duration-related variables deemed as most important and timing-related variables as most common among the selected features. Next, we will assess how these aspects predict women’s and men’s wealth in older age. Results will provide important impulses for inequality research and policy-related discussions.

**Decomposing the Gender Wealth Gap in late working age based on the most relevant family and work life course aspects**

<i>With Nicole Kapelle<i>
> This paper examines (I) which work and family life course variables covering elements of the order, duration, and timing of life course states are most relevant for wealth in older age, and (II) how these variables are associated with the gender wealth gap. Using German data and an approach that combines machine learning algorithms and sequence analysis tools with decomposition techniques, we extend previous research that either (I) assessed few, but potentially irrelevant summary wealth predictors, or (II) examined the relevance of entire life course clusters using sequence analyses without determining which single features matter. 

As a first step, we apply the Life Course Feature Selection to assess which work and family life course aspects are the most important pension predictors among a multitude of variables. We identify 20 relevant variables with duration-related variables deemed as most important among the selected life course variables. The duration of education is clearly the most important wealth predictor, followed by the duration of unemployment as well as the number of unemployment periods, the duration of being a childless single, and the duration of homemaking. Particularly the latter two predictors have usually not been used previously to analyse wealth inequalities.
As the next steps, we will decompose the Gender Wealth Gap based on the selected life course variables. Using a nonparametric decomposition technique, allows us to additionally quantify parts of the gap due to gender-exclusive combinations of life course experiences. Results will provide important impulses for inequality research and policy-related discussions.
