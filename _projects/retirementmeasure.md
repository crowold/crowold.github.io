excerpt: "Reviewing retirement measurements from a gender-sensitive perspective and revealing potential implications for old-age outcomes across contexts"
---

In this research project I review and discuss retirement measurements applied in studies on old-age inequalities and empirically reveal their implications for popular old-age outcomes across contexts. As first step, I systematically review the recent empirical literature in the social sciences on gender inequalities in old age, capturing and quantifying the measurements applied for retirement as well as old age. The second part assesses the impact of the measurements identified in the literature review on (i) sample characteristics, such as the share of women in the sample, as well as (ii.) popular gender differences in outcomes, such as the gender gap in pension income and wellbeing. Applying a Multiverse Analysis I reveal the heterogeneity of these outcomes depending on the retirement and old age definitions applied and thus the potential biases.
